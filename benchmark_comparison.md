# Benchmark Results: Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent | RL vs Non-RL

This document presents benchmark comparisons across two experimental setups:

1. **Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent**
2. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) vs Non-RL**

## 1. GeneralAgent vs Multi-Agent

| Metric              | Single-Agent | Multi-Agent |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Avg Satisfaction    | 3.6          | 4.1         |
| AI Answer Precision | Medium       | High        |
| Coherence           | 0.74         | 0.84        |

**Observation:**  
Multi-Agent systems outperform Single-Agent setups in all metrics, indicating higher user satisfaction, precision, and coherence.

## 2. RL vs Non-RL Agents

| Metric                   | No RL | With RL |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------- |
| Avg User Satisfaction    | 3.4   | 4.1     |
| Avg Agent Coherence      | 0.78  | 0.87    |
| Incorrect Agent Chosen % | 25%   | 8%      |

**Observation:**  
RL-enabled agents show significantly improved satisfaction, coherence, and accuracy, with a minor increase in response time.
